## Completion Grids

These are all "completion grids" in which there are rows to complete
with different information in each one.

* Circles: Completion grids for "angle at centre is twice angle at
  circumference" and "alternate segment theorem"
* Quadratics: different forms, value at different points, coordinates
  of vertex
* Pascal's Triangle
* Sequences: linear/arithmetic sequences
* Decimals: converting recurring decimals to fractions
* Proportion: different types of proportion
* Probability: uniform distribution

## Other Activities

* Polygons: drawings of regular polygons from 3-sides to 14-sides
